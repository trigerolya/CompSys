How is this list generated?
This list is generated from 128 "best of" book lists from a variety
 of great sources. An algorithm is used to create a master list
 based on how many lists a particular book appears on. Some lists count more than others.
 I generally trust "best of all time" lists voted by authors and experts over user-generated lists.
 On the lists that are actually ranked, the book that is 1st counts a lot more than the book that's 100th.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or corrections please feel free to e-mail me.
